<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this assignment you will write and analyze MIPS assembly code, and implement a cache simulator to evaluate the effects of different caching strategies on the number of cycles required to execute a sequence of memory references.</p>

<p>This is a pretty significant assignment, and we are giving you 2 full weeks to work on it.  This is because we <em>expect</em> it to require 2 weeks, so plan accordingly!</p>

<h3 id="expectation-of-original-work">Expectation of original work</h3>

<p>You might be able to find answers to these problems on the web.  Please resist the temptation to do this, and understand that turning in work that is not your original work is a violation of academic integrity.  All of these problems have straightforward solutions that you should be able to work out with a bit of thought and effort.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-mips-assembly-14">Problem 1: MIPS assembly (14%)</h2>

<p>Write a MIPS assembly language program that implements a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec_sum_sq</code>.  If it were a C function, it would have the following declaration:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">vec_sum_sq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="p">[],</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">vec1</span><span class="p">[],</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">vec2</span><span class="p">[],</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The parameters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec1</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec2</code> are all arrays of 32 bit int values.  The length of each array is specified by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> parameter.</p>

<p>The computation done by the function is that for each index <em>i</em> in the range 0 to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count-1</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result[</code><em>i</em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">] ← vec1[</code><em>i</em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]×vec1[</code><em>i</em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">] + vec2[</code><em>i</em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]×vec2[</code><em>i</em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, each element of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result</code> array should be assigned the sum of the squares of the corresponding elements of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec2</code>.</p>

<p>Use the following template for your program (copy these contents into a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Problem1.s</code>):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	.text

	.globl main
	.globl vec_sum_sq

main:
	la $a0, result
	la $a1, vec1
	la $a2, vec2
	la $t0, n_elts
	lw $a3, 0($t0)

	# save return address
	addi $sp, $sp, -4
	sw $ra, 0($sp)

	# call vec_sum_sq
	jal vec_sum_sq

	# restore return address
	lw $ra, 0($sp)
	addi $sp, $sp, 4

	# return from main
	jr $ra

# $a0 is base address of result vector.
# $a1 is base address of first argument vector.
# $a2 is base address of second argument vector.
# $a3 is the number of elements in the argument vectors.
vec_sum_sq:
	# TODO - add your code here!

########################################################################
# Data segment: you are free to change the value of the
# n_elt variables and the contents of the vec1 and vec2 arrays
# for testing purposes.

	.data
result:	.space 10000
n_elts:	.word 5
vec1:	.word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
vec2:	.word 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Test code is provided to allow you to test your function.
When you execute the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> function provided in the template,
which uses the provided <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n_elts</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec1</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec2</code> variables,
the first 5 elements of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result</code> array should contain the
values 37, 53, 73, 97, and 125.</p>

<p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spim</code> simulator to execute and debug your code.</p>

<h3 id="optimization">Optimization!</h3>

<p>Once you get your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vec_sum_sq</code> function working, try to optimize it
to avoid pipeline stalls.  Include a comments in your code indicating</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rationale for your optimization decisions, such as the
order of instructions, and</li>
  <li>how successful you think you were, and why</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problem-2-cache-simulator-56">Problem 2: Cache simulator (56%)</h2>

<p><strong>Acknowledgment</strong>: This problem was originally developed by <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phf">Peter Froehlich</a> for <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phf/2018/fall/cs229">his version of CSF</a>.</p>

<p>This problem focuses on simulating and evaluating
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_/(computing/)">caches</a>. We’ll give
you a number of <strong>memory traces</strong> from real benchmark programs. You’ll
implement a program to <strong>simulate</strong> how a variety of caches perform on
these traces. You’ll then use your programs and the given traces to
determine the <strong>best overall cache configuration</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h3>

<p>You can use either C or C++ for this assignment. You’re allowed to use
the <strong>standard</strong> library of your chosen language as much as you would
like to, but you are <strong>not</strong> allowed to use any additional
(non-standard) libraries.</p>

<!--
**We *highly* recommend that you opt for C++ because the C++ standard
library contains *many* useful data structures that you would have to
write *from scratch* in C\!** Don’t waste your time on data structures,
spend your time working on the *actual* problem\! **However, if you pick
C++ you must write *real* C++ code, not just “C with some classes added”
as it were\!**
-->
<p>One advantage of choosing C++ is that you can use the built-in
container data structures such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector</code>, etc.
Regardless of which language you use, we highly encourage you to
write modular, well-designed code, and to develop data types and
functions to manage the complexity of the program.</p>

<!--
We must be able to build your program on the Lubuntu 18.04 LTS reference
system using `make` with no additional arguments, so obviously you need
to include a working `Makefile` with your source code. Make sure you use
the C/C++ compiler flags posted on
[Piazza](http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2019/601229) and follow the style
guide posted there for your code.
-->

<p>Your must provide a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> such that</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make clean</code> removes all object files and executables, and</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make csim</code> compiles and links your program, producing an executable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csim</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Your code should compile cleanly with gcc 7.x using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Wall -Wextra --pedantic</code> compiler flags.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2a-cache-simulator-50">Problem 2(a): Cache Simulator (50%)</h3>

<p>You will design and implement a <strong>cache simulator</strong> that can be used to
study and compare the effectiveness of various cache configurations.
Your simulator will read a <strong>memory access trace</strong> from standard input,
simulate what a cache based on certain parameters would do in response
to these memory access patterns, and finally produce some summary
statistics to standard output. Let’s start with the file format of the
memory access traces:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>s 0x1fffff50 1
l 0x1fffff58 1
l 0x1fffff88 6
l 0x1fffff90 2
l 0x1fffff98 2
l 0x200000e0 2
l 0x200000e8 2
l 0x200000f0 2
l 0x200000f8 2
l 0x30031f10 3
s 0x3004d960 0
s 0x3004d968 1
s 0x3004caa0 1
s 0x3004d970 1
s 0x3004d980 6
l 0x30000008 1
l 0x1fffff58 4
l 0x3004d978 4
l 0x1fffff68 4
l 0x1fffff68 2
s 0x3004d980 9
l 0x30000008 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, each memory access performed by a program is recorded on
a separate line. There are three “fields” separated by white space. The
first field is either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code> depending on whether the processor is
“loading” from or “storing” to memory. The second field is a 32-bit
memory address given in hexadecimal; the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x</code> at the beginning means
“the following is hexadecimal” and is not itself part of the address.
You can <strong>ignore</strong> the third field for this assignment.</p>

<p>Your cache simulator will be configured with the following cache design
parameters which are given as command-line arguments (see below):</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of sets in the cache (a positive power-of-2)</li>
  <li>number of blocks in each set (a positive power-of-2)</li>
  <li>number of bytes in each block (a positive power-of-2, at least 4)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write-allocate</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no-write-allocate</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write-through</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write-back</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lru</code> (least-recently-used) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fifo</code> evictions</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that certain combinations of these design parameters account for
direct-mapped, set-associative, and fully associative caches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cache with n sets of 1 block each is direct-mapped</li>
  <li>a cache with n sets of m blocks each is m-way set-associative</li>
  <li>a cache with 1 set of n blocks is fully associative</li>
</ul>

<p>The smallest cache you must be able to simulate has 1 set with 1 block
with 4 bytes; this cache can only remember a single 4-byte memory
reference and nothing else; it can therefore only be beneficial if
consecutive memory references in a trace go to the exact same address.
<strong>You should probably use this tiny cache for basic sanity testing.</strong></p>

<p>A few reminders about the other three parameters: The <strong>write-allocate</strong>
parameter determines what happens for a <strong>cache miss</strong> during a
<strong>store</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write-allocate</code> we bring the relevant memory block into the
cache <em>before</em> the store proceeds</li>
  <li>for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no-write-allocate</code> a cache miss during a store does <em>not</em>
modify the cache</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this parameter interacts with the following one. The
<strong>write-through</strong> parameter determines whether a store <strong>always</strong> writes
to memory <strong>immediately</strong> or not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write-through</code> a store writes to the cache as well as to memory</li>
  <li>for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write-back</code> a store writes to the cache <em>only</em> and marks the
block <em>dirty</em>; if the block is evicted later, it has to be written
back to memory before being replaced</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It doesn’t make sense to combine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no-write-allocate</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write-back</code>
because we wouldn’t be able to actually write to the cache for the
store!</strong></p>

<p>The last parameter is only relevant for associative caches: in
direct-mapped caches there is no choice for which block to evict!</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lru</code> (least-recently-used) we evict the block that has not been
<strong>accessed</strong> the longest</li>
  <li>for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fifo</code> (first-in-first-out) we evict the block that has been
<strong>in the cache</strong> the longest</li>
</ul>

<p>Your cache simulator should assume that loads/stores from/to the cache
take <strong>one</strong> processor cycle; loads/stores from/to memory take <strong>100</strong>
processor cycles for <strong>each</strong> 4-byte quantity that is transferred. There
are plenty of things about caches in real processors that you do <strong>not</strong>
have to simulate, for example write buffers or smart ways to fill cache
blocks; implementing all the options above correctly is already somewhat
challenging, so we’ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>We expect to be able to run your simulator as follows:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./csim 256 4 16 write-allocate write-back lru &lt; sometracefile</code></p>

<p>This would simulate a cache with 256 sets of 4 blocks each (aka a 4-way
set-associative cache), with each block containing 16 bytes of memory;
the cache performs write-allocate but no write-through (so it does
write-back instead), and it evicts the least-recently-used block if it
has to. (As an aside, note that this cache has a total size of 16384
bytes (16 kB) if we ignore the space needed for tags and other
meta-information.)</p>

<p>After the simulation is complete, your cache simulator is expected to
print the following summary information in <strong>exactly</strong> the format given
below:</p>

<pre>Total loads: <i>count</i>
Total stores: <i>count</i>
Load hits: <i>count</i>
Load misses: <i>count</i>
Store hits: <i>count</i>
Store misses: <i>count</i>
Total cycles: <i>count</i>
</pre>

<p>The <tt><i>count</i></tt> value is simply an occurrence count.  As a concrete example,
here is an example invocation of the program on one of the example traces, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc.trace</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./csim 256 4 16 write-allocate write-back fifo &lt; gcc.trace
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This invocation should produce the following output:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Total loads: 318197
Total stores: 197486
Load hits: 314171
Load misses: 4026
Store hits: 188047
Store misses: 9439
Total cycles: 9845283
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that due to slight variations in how you might reasonably interpret the
simulator specification, your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Total cycles</code> value could be slightly different,
but should be fairly close.  For all of the other counts, your simulator’s
output should exactly match the output above.</p>

<p>We <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to use Piazza to post traces and simulator results,
so that you can compare your results with other students’ results.</p>

<h3 id="example-traces">Example traces</h3>

<p>Here are some traces you can use for testing and empirical evaluation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/hw/hw4_traces/gcc.trace">hw4_traces/gcc.trace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/hw/hw4_traces/read01.trace">hw4_traces/read01.trace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/hw/hw4_traces/read02.trace">hw4_traces/read02.trace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/hw/hw4_traces/read03.trace">hw4_traces/read03.trace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/hw/hw4_traces/swim.trace">hw4_traces/swim.trace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/hw/hw4_traces/write01.trace">hw4_traces/write01.trace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/hw/hw4_traces/write02.trace">hw4_traces/write02.trace</a></li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc.trace</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swim.trace</code> are traces from real programs, so you should
consider using them in your empirical evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<p>Your simulation is only concerned with hits and misses, at no point do
you need the <strong>actual</strong> data that’s stored in the cache; that’s the
reason why the trace files do not contain that information in the first
place.</p>

<p>Don’t try to implement all the options right away, start by writing a
simulator that can only run direct-mapped caches with write-through and
no-write-allocate. Once you have that working, extend step-by-step to
make the other design parameters work. Also, sanity-check your simulator
frequently with simple, hand-crafted traces for which you can still
derive manually what the behavior should be.</p>

<p><em>More hints coming soon…</em> (Sorry, no more hints will be forthcoming
on this assignment description page, but please do check out
<a href="http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2019/601229">Piazza</a>).</p>

<h3 id="problem-2b-best-cache-6">Problem 2(b): Best Cache? (6%)</h3>

<p>For the second problem, you’ll use the memory traces as well as your
simulator to determine which cache configuration has the <strong>best overall
effectiveness</strong>. You should take a variety of properties into account:
hit rates, miss penalties, total cache size (including overhead), etc.
In your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> describe in detail what experiments you ran (and
why!), what results you got (and how!), and what, in your opinion, is
the best cache configuration of them all.</p>

<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>

<p>The memory traces above come from a similar programming assignment by
Steven Swanson at the University of California, San Diego. Thank you
Steven!</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<p>Create a zipfile that has your MIPS assembly program for Problem 1
in a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Problem1.s</code>, as well as all of the files for Problem 2.
All of the files should be in the top level directory of the zipfile.
As an example, if your zipfile is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hw4.zip</code>, the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unzip -l hw4.zip</code> might produce the following output:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Archive:  hw4.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
    14719  2019-10-10 13:07   main.c
      149  2019-10-08 10:22   Makefile
     1186  2019-10-10 14:38   Problem1.s
    12075  2019-10-10 14:38   README
---------                     -------
    28129                     4 files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your exact output will almost certainly differ, for example, depending on
how you structured your program for Problem 2.</p>

<p>Upload your zipfile to Gradescope as <strong>HW4</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>For reference, here is a short explanation of the grading criteria; some
of the criteria don’t apply to all problems, and not all of the criteria
are used on all assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong> refers to the proper organization of the stuff you hand
in, following both the guidelines for Deliverables above as well as the
general submission instructions for assignments on
<a href="http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2019/601229">Piazza</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Style</strong> refers to C programming style, including things like
consistent indentation, appropriate identifier names, useful comments,
suitable documentation, etc. Simple, clean, readable code is what you
should be aiming for. Please see the <a href="https://jhucsf.github.io/fall2019/notes/style.html">Coding style guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong> refers to proper modularization (functions, modules, etc.)
and an appropriate choice of algorithms and data structures.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong> refers to how fast/with how little memory your programs
can produce the required results compared to other submissions.</p>

<p><strong>Functionality</strong> refers to your programs being able to do what they
should according to the specification given above; if the specification
is ambiguous, ask for clarification! (It also refers to you simply doing
the required work, which may not be programming alone.)</p>

<p><strong>If your programs cannot be built you will get no points whatsoever.</strong> If
your programs cannot be built without warnings using the required
compiler options given on
<a href="http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2019/601229">Piazza</a> we will take off 10%
(except if you document a <em>very</em> good reason). If your programs cannot
be built using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> we will take off 10%. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">valgrind</code> detects memory
errors in your programs, we will take off 10%. If your programs fail
miserably even once, i.e. terminate with an exception of any kind or
dump core, we will take off 10% (for each such case).</p>
