<div class="spacer"></div>
<ul><li>Readings for this topic from <i>Operating System Concepts</i>:
  none.
</li></ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<ul><li>When a process is running, what does its memory look like?
  A collection of regions called <i>sections</i>.
  Basic memory layout for Linux and other Unix systems:
  <ul><li>Code (or "text" in Unix terminology): starts at location 0
  </li><li>Data: starts immediately above code, grows upward
  </li><li>Stack: starts at highest address, grows downward
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<ul><li>System components that take part in managing a process's
  memory:
  <ul><li>Compiler and assembler:
    <ul><li>Generate one <i>object file</i> for each source code file
      containing information for that source file.
    </li><li>Information is incomplete, since each source file generally
      references some things defined in other source files.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Linker:
    <ul><li>Combines all of the object files for one program into
      a single object file.
    </li><li>Linker output is complete and self-sufficient.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Operating system:
    <ul><li>Loads object files into memory.
    </li><li>Allows several different processes to share memory at
      once.
    </li><li>Provides facilities for processes to get more memory after
      they've started running.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Run-time library:
    <ul><li>Works together with OS to provide dynamic allocation routines,
      such as <span class="code">malloc</span> and <span class="code">free</span> in C.
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
</li><li>Linkers (or Linkage Editors, <span class="code">ld</span> in Unix,
  <span class="code">LINK</span> on Windows):  combine
  many separate pieces of a program, re-organize storage
  allocation.  Typically invoked invisibly by compilers.
<div class="spacer"></div>
</li><li>Three functions of a linker:
  <ul><li>Collect all the pieces of a program.
  </li><li>Figure out a new memory organization so that all the
    pieces fit together (combine like sections).
  </li><li>Touch up addresses so that the program can run
    under the new memory organization.
  </li></ul>
</li><li>Result: a runnable program stored in a new object file
  called an <i>executable</i>.
<div class="spacer"></div>
</li><li>Problems linker must solve:
  <ul><li>Assembler doesn't know addresses of external objects when assembling
    files separately.  E.g. where is <span class="code">printf</span> routine?
    <ul><li>Assembler just puts zero in the object file for each unknown address
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Assembler doesn't know where the things it's assembling will
    go in memory
    <ul><li>Assume that things start at address zero, let linker re-arrange.
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
</li><li>Each object file consists of:
  <ul><li><i>Sections</i>, each holding a distinct kind of information.
    <ul><li>Typical sections: code ("text") and data.
    </li><li>For each section, object file contains size and current location
      of the section, plus initial contents, if any
    </li></ul>
  </li><li><i>Symbol table</i>: name and current location of variable or procedure
    that can potentially be referenced in other object files.
  </li><li><i>Relocation records </i>: information about addresses referenced
    in this object file that the linker must adjust once it knows the
    final memory allocation.
  </li><li>Additional information for debugging (e.g. map from line numbers
    in the source file to location in the code section).
  </li></ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
</li><li>Example files:
  <br><span class="code">main.c</span>:
  <div class="code"><pre>extern float sin();
extern printf(), scanf();

main() {
  double x, result;
  printf("Type number: ");
  scanf("%f", &amp;x);
  result = sin(x);
  printf("Sine is %f\n",
        result);
}
</pre></div>
  <br><span class="code">stdio.c</span>:
  <div class="code"><pre>int printf(char *fmt, ...) {
  ...
}
int scanf(char *fmt, ...) {
  ...
}
</pre></div>
  <br><span class="code">math.c</span>:
  <div class="code"><pre>double sin(double x) {
  static double res, lastx;
  if (x != lastx) {
    lastx = x;
    ... compute sin(x) ...
  }
  return res;
}
</pre></div>
<div class="spacer"></div>
</li><li>Linker executes in two passes:
  <ul><li>Pass 1: read in section sizes, compute final memory layout.
    Also, read in all symbols, create complete symbol table in memory.
  </li><li>Pass 2: read in section and relocation information, update
    addresses, write out new file.
  </li></ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
</li><li>Relocation records:
  <ul><li>Address and size of the value to be relocated
  </li><li>Symbol that determines amount of relocation
  </li><li>How to relocate:
    <ul><li>Overwrite with final address of symbol
    </li><li>Add final address of symbol to current contents; used for
      accessing element of record:
      <div class="code"><pre>x = y.q;
</pre></div>
      <span class="code">y</span> is an external symbol, but the offset <span class="code">q</span> is
      known from a header file
    </li><li>Add difference between final and original addresses of
      symbol to current contents
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2>Dynamic Linking</h2>
<ul><li>Originally all programs were linked <i>statically</i>, as described
  above:
  <ul><li>All external references fully resolved
  </li><li>Each program complete
  </li></ul>
</li><li>Since late 1980's most systems have supported <i>shared libraries</i>
  and <i>dynamic linking</i>:
  <ul><li>For common library packages, only keep a single copy in memory,
    shared by all processes.
  </li><li>Don't know where library is loaded until runtime; must resolve
    references dynamically, when program runs.
  </li></ul>
</li><li>One way of implementing dynamic linking: <i>jump table</i>.
  <ul><li>Jump table: an array in which each entry is a single machine
    instruction containing an unconditional branch (jump).
  </li><li>For each function in a shared library used by the program, there
    is one entry in the jump table that will jump to the beginning of
    that function.
  </li><li>If one of the files being linked is a shared library, the linker
    doesn't actually include the shared library code in the final program.
    Instead it creates a jump table with slots for all of the functions
    that are used from that library.
  </li><li>For relocation records referring to functions in the shared library,
    the linker substitutes the address of the jump table entry: when
    the function is invoked, the caller will "call" the jump table entry,
    which redirects the call to the real function.
  </li><li>When the program starts up, the shared library is loaded into memory
    and the jump table addresses are adjusted to reflect the load location.
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
